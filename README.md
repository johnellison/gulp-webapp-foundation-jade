Gulp Webapp--Foundation &amp; Jade
===========================

Front-end boilerplate using Foundation 5, Jade, and Gulp. Based on [Generator Gulp Webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp). I will be migrating this into a [Yo](http://yeoman.io/) Generator for scaffolding projects.

## Features

Please see [gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js) for up to date information on what features are supported.

* [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) templating
* CSS Autoprefixing
* Built-in preview server with livereload (localhost)
* Automagically compile Sass
* Automagically lint your scripts
* Awesome image optimization
* Automagically wire-up dependencies installed with [Bower](http://bower.io) *(when `gulp watch` or `gulp wiredep`)*

## Purpose

This repo is meant to provide a basic starting point for a front-end web project using the latest version of Foundation alongside the Jade templating language.
